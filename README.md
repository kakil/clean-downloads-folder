# Clean Your Downloads Folder Automatically With Python

# Project Brief
Your task for this project is to write a Python script, which when executed, deletes all files and directories contained in your computerâ€™s Downloads folder. Optionally, you can schedule the script to be executed at a certain time every day or when the computer starts. That would keep your Downloads folder uncluttered.
